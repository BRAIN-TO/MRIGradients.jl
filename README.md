This package provides tools and structures to manipulate and apply gradient impulse response functions (GIRFs) to acquired imaging data using the MRIReco.jl datatypes.

To use this package, clone the repo into your `.julia/dev/` folder, and add the package to your environment using `dev MRIGradients` in the package manager mode in the Julia REPL.

Then, in your script, proceed with the `using MRIGradients` statement as usual.
